# API Gateway Vs Load Balancer

## Key Differences Between API Gateway and Load Balancer

| Feature                 | **API Gateway**                             | **Load Balancer**                       | **Use Cases**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**     | API management, routing, and transformation | Traffic distribution across servers     | Exposing APIs, microservices architecture, handling complex API requests     |
| **Protocols Supported**  | HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, REST           | HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSocket         | API management, request routing for web and mobile apps                       |
| **Features**             | Authentication, rate limiting, caching, transformation | Load balancing, health checks, session persistence | API security, traffic management, fault tolerance, and high availability     |
| **Use Case**             | Exposing and managing APIs in a microservices architecture | Distributing load and ensuring availability across servers | Routing client requests to appropriate backend services, scaling web applications |
| **Security**             | Handles API-level security, OAuth, JWT, etc. | Can handle SSL termination, but no detailed API security | Protecting APIs, ensuring secure communication, and managing server traffic |
| **Traffic Routing**      | Routes based on API endpoint (path-based)   | Routes based on load balancing algorithms (round-robin, least connections, etc.) | Managing large volumes of traffic to backend services or servers            |
